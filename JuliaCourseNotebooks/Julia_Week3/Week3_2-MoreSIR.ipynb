    "<h2>The threshold prediction of our SIR model</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the three equations of our SIR model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 ...     $ S(t_{i+1}) = S(t_i) - \\lambda S(t_i)I(t_i)\\,dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "2 ...     $I(t_{i+1}) = I(t_i) + \\lambda S(t_i)I(t_i)\\,dt - \\gamma I(t_i)\\,dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "3 ...     $R(t_{i+1}) = R(t_i) + \\gamma I(t_i)\\,dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "And recall that $S(t)$ is a symbol for the size of the susceptible population (not yet infected) at time $t$, likewise $I(t)$ represents the infecteds, and $R(t)$ the removeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\lambda$ models the likelihood that when an infected person meets a susceptible person, the susceptible person becomes infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\gamma$ models the rate at which infected people become removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task in this lecture is to propose estimates for the parameter values. To do so, we will use the *threshold phenomenon* of our model: for given values of $\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$, there is no epidemic unless $S(0)$ is big enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning is simple: for an epidemic to happen, the infection must spread. But that means more people must be getting infected than are recovering. That is, the gain minus the loss of infecteds must be positive. In symbols, we must have\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda SI - \\gamma I > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can only happen if $\\lambda S - \\gamma > 0$. In other words, the number of infecteds can increase only when $S > \\gamma/\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that if the initial population is below the threshold, indicated by $S(0) < \\gamma/\\lambda$, then the number of infecteds, even if initially large, will decrease. That is, in a small enough population, any initial infection simply dies out. On the other hand, if $S(0)>\\gamma/\\lambda$, the number of infecteds will increase, at least for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of course obvious that for our model to apply to the West African epidemic, our parameter values must be such that the susceptible population at the beginning of 2014 was larger than $\\gamma/\\lambda$. \n",

    "\n",
    "We note that the loss rate of infecteds is given by $\\gamma I$. This means that every day, the fraction of infected people becoming removed is $\\gamma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider $\\gamma = 1/10$. Then every day a tenth of ill people recover. If we assume that every person is ill for 10 days, and as many people are getting ill as recovering, then a tenth of all ill people recover every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it makes sense to think of the duration of one person's illness as $1/\\gamma$. Recall that the duration of EVD is approximately three weeks. This means we may estimate that $1/\\gamma\\approx 21$. We will therefore set $\\gamma=0.05$ as a reasonable estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crude to think that they are equally infectious every day of these three weeks, but that is what we are doing. Our assumption was that the only difference between people is whether they are susceptible, infected or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, it is crude to think that all infected people are ill in the same way and for the same duration, but again this is what we do. In fact, without a lot more data (especially data on duration of illness) and a considerably more complicated model, this is all we can do. "
