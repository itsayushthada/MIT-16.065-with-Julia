Moreover, in our model there is no explicit record of the number of cases. Therefore we have first to work out how to get our model to tell us what the total number of cases are.\n",

But every such person is either in the infected group currently or has moved to the removed group. So the total number of cases at time $t$ is $I(t) + R(t)$. We will use $C(t)$ to denote the modelled number of cases, and $W(t)$ for the reported number of cases from Wikipedia."
